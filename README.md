# Trackduino2
Trackduino is Trackdisplay reader for Commodore 1541 Drives. It's based on an original project from oe7twj (don't know his real name) 
It is able ro read the Track position of the read/write head and display it on a 4 digit LED Display along with the motor rotation animation and the half track indication.

This particulary version includes also the feature to be used with a LCD 16x2 display as well. 
Trackduino2 can be easily plugged into the MOS 6522 VIA Chip socket of the 1541 mainboard without any oter external connections, as it already includes the Arduino Nano onboard and all the necessari connections on its adapter board.
